                    <li>The dataset consists of daily historical stock data for Tesla Inc. (TSLA) from 2012 to 2022, including features like Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume.</li>
                    <li>The primary goal is to predict the adjusted closing price (Adj Close) using various regression methods and compare their performance.</li>
                    <li>The project uses methods assuming independent and identically distributed data, which is not suitable for time series data; more appropriate models like ARIMA should have been considered.</li>

                    <li>A custom GMM model is implemented from scratch, with initialization of parameters using KMeans, followed by applying the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to fit the model to the honest data.</li>
                    <li>The custom GMM model is created, which includes fitting the model to training data, calculating class priors, and predicting probabilities for each sample, with log-likelihoods used to deduce the fraud detection threshold.</li>
                    <li>The model's log-likelihoods are plotted to identify a threshold point where the density drop indicates fraud detection, completing the fraud detection pipeline.</li>
